## 👋 About Me

I'm Mihir Thakkar — Founder & CEO of **Ostrich AI**, where we're building secure and scalable AI infrastructure for enterprises. My journey spans business ops, manufacturing, logistics, and applied AI — all leading to one goal: turning real-world friction into systemized intelligence.

🔐 Recently granted a **patent** for a dual-key, blockchain-based architecture for enterprise-grade AI deployment — designed with compliance and IP protection at its core.

I still explore, prototype, and share ideas here on GitHub, especially around automation, privacy-preserving AI, and distributed compute.

## 🛠 What I Work With

I'm focused on tools that help ship **real-world AI**—fast, secure, and with clarity:
- AI/ML frameworks for vision, NLP, and forecasting
- Lightweight automation and orchestration stacks
- Privacy-first deployment pipelines
- Dashboards, scripts, and infrastructure-as-code when needed
